# Project Description
A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures:

### 1- Nitrogen content ratio in the soil.
### 2- Phosphorous content ratio in the soil.
### 3- Potassium content ratio in the soil.
### 4- pH value of the soil.# 

# Project Instructions
### 1- Could you identify the single feature that has the strongest predictive performance for classifying crop types?
### 2- Find the feature in the dataset that produces the best score for predicting "crop".
### 3- From this information, create a variable called best_predictive_feature, which:
### 4- A dictionary should contain the best predictive feature name as a key and the evaluation score (for the metric you chose) as the value.
