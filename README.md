Project Description
A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures:

Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
Potassium content ratio in the soil
pH value of the soil

Project Instructions
Identify the single feature that has the strongest predictive performance for classifying crop types.

Find the feature in the dataset that produces the best score for predicting "crop".
From this information, create a variable called best_predictive_feature, which:
Should be a dictionary containing the best predictive feature name as a key and the evaluation score (for the metric you chose) as the value.
